# UPI Scam Guide: steps to report and freeze the Scammer

## Important Note
This does not guarantee a refund but it does *freeze the scammer's account* and stops them from scamming others.

Their account usually stays frozen until you withdraw the complaint (best way to get refund) or they legally prove innocence/not guilty.

## Follow these steps immediately:

1. **Collect all evidence**: UPI ID, transaction reference number, account number, IFSC and screenshot of chats

2. **File a complaint to your bank** - complain ID will be provided.

3. **File a complaint on NPCI** (it works) - https://www.npci.org.in/upi-complaint 

4. **File a cyber crime report** and visit your local cyber cell if possible - https://cybercrime.gov.in 

5. **Email your bank branch manager** with full proof (optional, but helps escalation).

## Result

Once reported, the scammer's account get reviewed and usually gets frozen after Cyber Cell informs the bank.
